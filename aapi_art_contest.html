But most of all, I love the Buddha watching over us, his presence shining down from the Sun.</p>

      <p><strong>Title: A Deer of Nine Colors </strong> </p>
      <p>Artist: Andrew Zhao </p>
      <p> "A Deer of Nine Colors" is a Chinese Buddhist tale, famously depicted in the Dunhuang cave murals, about a magical multicolored deer who saves a drowning man but is later betrayed for a reward. When the king confronts the deer, its compassion and wisdom move him to spare its life and punish the traitor. The story, preserved in the vibrant wall paintings of the Mogao Caves, conveys timeless lessons about kindness, loyalty, and the consequences of greed.</p>

      <p> This project was done by Ruby McAteer at her home. This is her entry paragraph -this garden features an Indian Princess sitting with a village Snake Charmer in the palace garden. As you can see, this picture is based in India and was inspired by a dream I had about the same thing. The buildinga in the background I copied from reference books. Part of the inspiration for this picture came from the interest I have in Indian culture this year. In conclusion I hope everyone who sees it enjoys this picture. </p>

      <p> The Drawing is showing one of the most important traditional chinese festival — Dragon Boat Festival. The festival on the 5th day of the 5th month in the chinese lunar calendar, is to commemorate QU Yuan, an upright and honest poet and politician of the Chu State during the Warring States Period. The two most famous traditions and customs are Dragon Boat races and making and eating Zongzi (a rice dumpling wrapped in bamboo leaves). In the drawing, the crews of zongzi are making their best efforts to win the race. </p>

      <p><strong>Title: 青花瓷企鹅姐弟组合Blue-and-White Porcelain Penguin Siblings </strong> </p>
      <p>Artist: Vivienne Chen </p>
      <p> 我女儿小名叫QQ，是参考腾讯聊天软件的Logo而取的名字。当我怀她的时候，由于体型较胖、走路摇摆像企鹅，于是我们亲切地叫她“QQ”。从小她就非常喜欢企鹅，也对中国传统文化中的青花瓷情有独钟。这次画作是她灵感的结合：一只背着书包上学的青花瓷企鹅，象征她对学习的热爱，也体现了她对传统艺术与动物的喜爱。画面左下角的小企鹅代表她的弟弟，也背着书包一起去上学，表现出兄妹之间的情感与共成长的主题。她巧妙地将青花瓷的纹样应用在企鹅身上，展现出传统与创意的融合。My daughter's nickname is QQ, inspired by the logo of the Tencent messaging app. When I was pregnant with her, I walked with a waddle due to weight gain, much like a penguin—so we affectionately called her "QQ." Since she was little, she has loved penguins and has also had a deep appreciation for traditional Chinese porcelain, especially blue-and-white ceramics. In this painting, she creatively combined these two passions by illustrating a blue-and-white porcelain penguin going to school with a backpack. The small penguin in the bottom left corner represents her younger brother, also heading to school, symbolizing sibling bond and growth together. The artwork integrates traditional patterns into the form of a penguin, merging cultural heritage with imaginative expression. </p>

      <p>Artist: Anya Sun </p>
      <p> The Moon Festival is like an Asian Thanksgiving—a time for family, love, and good food. It’s one of my favorite holidays because my parents, my brothers, and I come together to enjoy a big, delicious meal with crabs, mooncakes, and sweet fruit. After dinner, my mom tells us the story of Chang’e, the moon fairy, and her rabbit, just like her parents told her. We laugh, share stories, and look up at the big, bright moon, feeling warm and happy. It’s a special tradition that brings us closer and is a special part of our family and our American life! </p>

      <p>Artist: Irene Zhao </p>
      <p> The Dunhuang Buddha wall paintings, found in the Mogao Caves near the Silk Road town of Dunhuang, are among the most remarkable treasures of ancient Buddhist art. Created between the 4th and 14th centuries, these vibrant murals depict scenes from the life of the Buddha, Buddhist sutras, celestial beings, and tales like "A Deer of Nine Colors." Blending artistic styles from China, India, and Central Asia, the paintings not only reflect deep spiritual devotion but also offer a vivid glimpse into the cultural exchange and religious life of the time.</p>

      <p><strong>Title: Strength of the Bayanihan spirit </strong> </p>
      <p>Artist: Nadezhda</p>
      <p> My art piece is specifically representing the Filipino people. What specifically encouraged me to choose to represent the Filipino people in my painting was my grandmother, who was originally from the Philippines before moving to the United States. I wanted to incorporate Bayanihan, which means "being a bayan.” The word bayan means town, community, nation, and anything that's close to that. Bayanihan is used to refer to the spirit of communal unity, cooperation, and helping your community without the expectation of something in return.   So I illustrated a common depiction of Bayanihan, which is a tradition of moving a family’s nipa by using the strength of the community. The Filipino belief of communal unity and supporting your community helped past Filipino immigrants in the USA to build strong communities to survive discrimination and economic hardship. On the side there is a woman who's wearing the traditional Filipino dress, a baro't saya. I also added the national flower of the Philippines, Sampaguita Jasmine. The bright, vibrant colors are to represent the kindness and warmth of the Filipinos.</p>

      <p>Artist: Ellen Zhou</p>
      <p> The oil painting, The Flowing Canvas of Friendship Beyond the Borders, portrays a rendition of the breathtakingly beautiful Ban Gioc-Detian Waterfalls. The cascading falls are located across the borders between Cao Bang Province, Vietnam and China's Daxin County, Guangxi, and is the largest transnational waterfall in Asia. The powerful whitewater is surrounded with lush green vegetation, which reflects the power and calm hidden in nature. Embraced by a blanket of captivating foggy-mist and accompanied with stunning green-blue water, the waterfalls also symbolize unity. The falls do not recognize borders; instead, they showcase a peaceful harmony between two countries. This depiction of the landform represents how when kindness and community meet, they create a beautiful friendship among people with different cultures and backgrounds. </p>

      <p><strong>Title: Peony </strong> </p>
      <p>Artist: Samantha Lee</p>
      <p> My artwork is a ceramic peony on a tile set in a wooden frame. Peonies, or moran (모란), frequently appeared in Korean artwork, especially during the Joseon dynasty. Specifically, peonies were symbols of wealth and honor. This is reflected in their voluminous layers of pink petals. Additionally, the glaze used for the tile is a color that closely resembles celadon, a gray-green glaze characteristic of the Goryeo dynasty. The wood frame has been stained darker to highlight the flower, and it can be viewed upright or flat. As a Korean-American, I love learning about Korean culture, and I hope my piece makes other people more curious about Korea and its rich history.</p>
